### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `ai-review-action.js` and `ai-review-action.test.js` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The existing Jenkins plugin structure can be referenced for patterns but this implementation will be GitHub Actions-based as specified in the PRD.

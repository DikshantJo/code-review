# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Code Review System

## Introduction/Overview

The AI-Powered Code Review System is an automated code quality gate that integrates with GitHub to perform intelligent code reviews when code moves between environments (Dev → UAT → Production). The system addresses the challenge of limited manual review capacity by providing consistent, rule-based AI analysis that catches security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and coding standard violations before code reaches production.

**Problem Statement**: Development teams lack the capacity to perform thorough manual code reviews for every commit moving between environments, leading to potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality problems reaching production.

**Goal**: Automate code review processes using AI to ensure code quality, security, and adherence to standards when code moves between development environments, while providing actionable feedback through GitHub issues.

## Goals

1. **Automate Code Review Process**: Eliminate manual review bottlenecks by automatically reviewing code when it moves between Dev, UAT, and Production branches
2. **Ensure Code Quality**: Catch security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and coding standard violations before production deployment
3. **Provide Actionable Feedback**: Generate detailed GitHub issues with specific recommendations for identified problems
4. **Maintain Audit Trail**: Track all reviews performed with detailed logs for compliance and debugging
5. **Minimize False Positives**: Achieve zero to low false alarm rates through well-defined, dynamic review rules
6. **Ensure Security**: Never expose credentials or sensitive information to AI services
7. **Enforce Production Quality Gates**: Optionally block high-severity issues from reaching production with emergency override capability

## User Stories

1. **As a DevOps Engineer**, I want automated code reviews triggered when code moves between environments so that I can ensure quality gates are enforced without manual intervention.

2. **As a Team Lead**, I want to receive notifications about code review failures so that I can prioritize and assign issues to the appropriate developers.

3. **As a Developer**, I want detailed feedback about code issues with specific recommendations so that I can quickly understand and fix problems.

4. **As a Project Manager**, I want configurable review rules so that different projects can have appropriate quality standards.

5. **As a Security Engineer**, I want security-focused reviews to catch vulnerabilities early so that security issues don't reach production.

6. **As a Release Manager**, I want the ability to block high-severity issues from reaching production while maintaining flexibility for urgent deployments.

   - The system must support rule enabling/disabling per project

### 5. **Issue Creation and Notification**
   - The system must create GitHub issues when reviews fail
   - The system must include issue title format: "Code Review [BranchName]"
   - The system must include severity level in the issue
   - The system must include source and target branch information
   - The system must include detailed issue descriptions from AI
   - The system must include specific fix recommendations
   - The system must assign issues to team leads (configurable)
   - The system must send email notifications to team leads when AI service is down

### 6. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - The system must handle AI service downtime by sending email notifications to team leads
   - The system must handle large commits that exceed token limits by splitting reviews or skipping with notification
   - The system must handle malformed AI responses by retrying or creating generic issues
   - The system must provide fallback mechanisms when AI responses don't follow expected format

### 7. **Production Quality Gates (Optional Feature)**
   - The system must support optional blocking of high-severity issues from reaching production branches
   - The system must create GitHub status checks that can be required for branch protection
   - The system must parse commit messages for "URGENT" keyword to allow emergency overrides
   - The system must log all override attempts with commit message and author information
   - The system must support configurable severity thresholds for blocking (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - The system must provide clear error messages when merges are blocked due to quality issues

### 8. **Audit and Logging**
   - The system must log all review attempts with timestamps
   - The system must log review outcomes (pass/fail)
   - The system must log AI response times and quality metrics
   - The system must maintain audit trails for compliance purposes
   - The system must log all production quality gate decisions and override attempts

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Manual Review Replacement**: This system does not replace human code reviews entirely; it supplements them
2. **Creative Code Suggestions**: The AI will not provide creative solutions or architectural recommendations
3. **Integration with External CI/CD**: Initial implementation will not integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines
4. **Real-time Review**: Reviews are triggered by branch movements, not real-time during development
